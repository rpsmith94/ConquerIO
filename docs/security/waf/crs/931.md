Rules with the 931xxx prefix protect web applications from remote file inclusion attempts that can be made by attackers.

## Paranoia Level 1 (default)

<details>
<summary id="931100">Rule: 931100</summary>

Protects web applications from directory traversal attacks. This will inspect request args, headers and files to ensure that no directory traversal attempts are made by the client.

**Message:** `Possible Remote File Inclusion (RFI) Attack: URL Parameter using IP Address`

**Example:**

```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:8088/?q=https%3A%2F%2F1.1.1.1%2Findex.php'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary id="931110">Rule: 931110</summary>

Prevents the use of include statements in a request payload.

**Message:** `Possible Remote File Inclusion (RFI) Attack: Common RFI Vulnerable Parameter Name used w/URL Payload`

**Example:**

```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:8088/?q=include(%22ftp%3A%2F%2F1.1.1.1%2Ftest.php%22)'
```

</details>

<details>

**Example:**

```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:8088/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fattacker.net%2Ftest.php%3F'
```

<details>

Some application packages will implicitly interpret `url:file://` as a local address and include them without checking existence locally.

**Message:** `Possible Remote File Inclusion (RFI) Attack: Off-Domain Reference/Link`

**Example:**

```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:8088/?q=uri%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fattacker.net%2Ffile.jar'
```
