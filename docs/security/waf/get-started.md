QuantCDN WAF is an optional extra that needs to be enabled for your account. To begin you will need to [contact support](https://support.quantcdn.io) and request WAF enablement for your organisation.

A WAF's aim is to protect dynamic systems from potentially harmful traffic patterns.

## Enabling WAF for your application

:::tip
When first enabling the WAF it is recommended to set the WAF in **report** mode. This will allow you to analyze traffic patterns and formulate a ruleset that will not impact your legitimate traffic.
:::

Once your account has WAF enabled you can utilise the [rules](https://dashboard.quantcdn.io/rules) page to add WAF and configure WAF to a proxy rule.

To add a rule:
1. Navigate to [rules](https://dashboard.quantcdn.io/rules)
2. Create or edit a **proxy rule**
3. Scroll down to *WAF settings* and check the **Enable WAF**

#### IP rate limiting

To better protect your application, the WAF can be configured to provide rate limits to request IPs. The rate limiting protects against burst IP traffic, the request rate needs to be sustained over a short period to trigger.

:::tip
When configuring the rate limit ensure to factor in asset requests — if you're average page load includes 200 assets this needs to be included as the rate limit is per proxy hit not per page view.
:::

| Setting         | Default  | Description                                                        |

| RPS threshold   | 10       | The number of requests that are required to trigger the rate limit |
| Cooldown period | 30       | Number of seconds a client's IP address will be restricted |

When the rate limit is reached the WAF will respond with a 429 status code.

#### Request header rate limiting
