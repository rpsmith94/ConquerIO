You may protect your projects from public access by requiring a username and password.

Navigate to the projects section of the dashboard, and edit any project to update authentication settings.

Simply provide a username and password to protect the project with basic authentication.

Use the "Preview domain only" option to prevent public access on the preview domain only.
