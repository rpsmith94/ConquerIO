It's launch time! ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰

After a long time conceptualising, developing, testing, and confirming our assumptions with some of the biggest sites on the web we are ready for action.

We are huge advocates of the static web, and all it represents. Serving efficiency, speed, security, simplicity. QuantCDN was born from a desire to make things even better. By **lowering the barrier** and providing turnkey solutions we put the static web in reach of even more people. By providing **rich APIs** we continue to allow developers to continue to do what they do best.

QuantCDN is a modern, global edge CDN backed on reliable and proven cloud-agnostic infrastructure. Read more about the features of the [Quant static edge platform](https://www.quantcdn.io/features).

This blog will serve as a central place to share release notes, upcoming features and musings on the static web movement.
